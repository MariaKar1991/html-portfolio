<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Since I discovered my passion for programming in 2020, I've thrown myself into
  software development learning, and experimentation. I've found myself drawn to
  web development, and now after having completed many courses and developed a
  number of applications to hone my skills, I am looking for my first software
  dev role so that I can focus on my love of programming full time. I am a
  passionate, inquisitive, highly motivated, and hardworking individual, who is
  always looking to learn and improve. I am seeking to join a dev team of
  like-minded individuals, where I can make impactful contributions and assist
  with whatever needs to be done. With my outgoing communicative nature, I have
  a strong aptitude for teamwork and collaboration, and already in my hobby dev
  projects, I'm coordinating remote development efforts with others via Discord.
  Are you looking for a highly motivated junior dev to join your team? If so,
  let's chat!
